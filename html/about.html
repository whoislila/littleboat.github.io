        <p>
          Little Boat is a long-term project devoted to cinema and moving images. It hosts
          independent screenings, critical and personal writing, translation projects, and
          collaborations with artists, programmers, and institutions. Rather than chasing spectacle,
          Little Boat prefers a quiet, patient and continuous rhythm: building a small, steady space
          where the works we care about can encounter the right audiences, rooms, and conversations.

          <h2>Little Boat</h2>
          <p>
            Little Boat takes its name from a small boat that lingers close to the shore—modest in
            scale, but patient enough to approach images and stories that are often overlooked by
            larger circuits and institutions. We are drawn to auteur cinema, experimental films, essay
            films, home movies, and any delicate attempt to think through space, memory, and time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, Little Boat curates occasional screening programs, conversations, and reading
            suggestions. We document each project carefully—program notes, posters, booklets, stills,
            on-site observations—and gradually organize essays, translations, and research fragments on
            this site, so that every small gesture leaves a visible and traceable record.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that steady, attentive documentation matters more than one-off “grand events.”
            The Archive section is therefore designed as a slow-growing resource: collecting programming
            intentions, collaborating venues, audience responses, and the ideas that emerge along the
            way, to offer open references for future curating, writing, and study.
          </p>
          <p>
            Little Boat welcomes collaboration with cinemas, independent screening spaces, publishers,
            writers, and filmmakers themselves. If you are working on a film, a book, or a cross-media
            project that might find a home on this small boat, we would be glad to be in touch.
          </p>
